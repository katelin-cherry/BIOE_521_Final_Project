Simple Focus Stacker

This code will take a series of images and merge them so that each
pixel is taken from the image with the sharpest focus at that location.

The logic is roughly the following:

1.  Align the images.  Changing the focus on a lens, even
    if the camera remains fixed, causes a mild zooming on the images.
    We need to correct the images so they line up perfectly on top
    of each other.

2.  Perform a gaussian blur on all images

3.  Compute the laplacian on the blurred image to generate a gradient map

4.  Create a blank output image with the same size as the original input
    images

4.  For each pixel [x,y] in the output image, copy the pixel [x,y] from
    the input image which has the largest gradient [x,y]
    

This algorithm was inspired by the high-level description given at
