# Raspberry Pi Microscope
#### Team 11: House of Pies - Katelin Cherry & Melody Tan

#### Brainstorm
We will set up a USB microscope controlled by a Raspberry Pi and a sample platform driven by a single-axis motor that will move the specimen to different distances below the objective. We will then use focus stacking to take images at increments below the objective and composite the in-focus portions of those images into a single, beautiful image.
